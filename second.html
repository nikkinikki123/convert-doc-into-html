          Bourbon is flowing in Kentucky, but donâ€™t grab a glass.
  Thousands of full barrels of bourbon, and possibly other spirits, came crashing down
  when a storage warehouse in Bardstown, Ky., partly collapsed on Friday.
  The collapse at the Barton 1792 Distillery campus was called in to emergency
   services about 10:55 a.m., Milt Spalding, an emergency services director
   in Nelson County, said during a
   <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/food/spirits/bourbon/2018/06/22/kentucky-distillery-barton-1792-collapses/725686002/">

   news conference</a> on Friday.
  The structure houses about 20,000 barrels, and an aerial video showed
   half of the building demolished. About 9,000 barrels were amid the rubble, Mr. Spalding said. Each barrel holds 53 gallons.
